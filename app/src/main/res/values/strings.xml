    <string name="section_a_instruction"><b>Instructions:</b> This questionnaire asks about problems you may have had after a very stressful experience involving
actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. It could be something that happened to you directly,
something you witnessed, or something you learned happened to a close family member or close friend. Some
examples are a serious accident; fire; disaster such as a hurricane, tornado, or earthquake; physical or sexual attack or abuse; war; homicide; or suicide.\nFirst, please answer a few questions about your worst event, which for this questionnaire means the event that
currently bothers you the most. This could be one of the examples above or some other very stressful experience. Also, it could be a single event (for example, a car crash) or multiple similar events (for example, multiple stressful events in a war-zone or repeated sexual abuse).
